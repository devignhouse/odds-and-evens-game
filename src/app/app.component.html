        <li>Create three new components: GameControl, Odd and Even</li>
        <li>The GameControl Component should have buttons to Start and Stop the game</li>
        <li>
          When starting the game, an event (holding an incrementing number)
          should get emitted each second (ref = setInterval())
        </li>
        <li>The event should be listenable outside of the component</li>
        <li>When stopping the game, no more events should get emitted (clearInterval(ref))</li>
        <li>
          A new Odd component should get created for every odd number emitted,
          the same should happen for the Even Component (on even numbers)
        </li>
        <li>Simply output Odd - NUMBER or Even - NUMBER in the two components</li>
        <li>Style the element (eg. paragraph) holding your output differently in both components</li>
      </ol>
